## Building
To build the application run
```shell script
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Running
From the build directory, run
```shell script
./pipeline
```

## Expected results
The expected results are
```
===============================================================================
All tests passed (10 assertions in 2 test cases)
```

## Doing the Kata
The goal is to refactor the tangled conditional logic in the `run` method in the
`Pipeline.cpp` file.
